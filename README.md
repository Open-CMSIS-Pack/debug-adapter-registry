# debug-adapter-registry

This repository contains the [debug adapter registry](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/build-operation/#debug-adapter-integration) and the CMSIS Solution extension specific adapter template files.

```txt
  ğŸ“¦
  â”£ ğŸ“‚ registry               shared debug adapter registry
  â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“„ debug-adapters.yml    yaml document listing all available debug adapters
  â”— ğŸ“‚ templates              command line tool source code
    â”£ ğŸ“„ *.adapter.json       json template for vscode launch and task definitions per debug adapter  
    â”— ğŸ“„ ...
```

The adapter registry is used by CMSIS-Toolbox starting version 2.9.0 to generate `<solution>+<target-type>.cbuild-run.yml` files for the active target-set selected by 

```
cbuild setup <solution> --active <target-type>[@<set>]
```

Available target-sets are listed by running

```
cbuild list target-sets <solution>
```

The `<solution>+<target-type>.cbuild-run.yml` file is then processed by the CMSIS Solution extension to generate launch.json and task.json files from the debug adapter template files.
